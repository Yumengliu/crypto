## How to run the server

Make sure you are currently in crypto/ folder, then run the following command:

```mvn spring-boot:run```

## Note

I made assumption that for each trading, it will use 60% of the current USD balance. You can change this setting in
the `application.properties` file:

```TRADING_PERCENTAGE=0.6```
